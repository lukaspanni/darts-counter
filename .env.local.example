# PostHog Configuration
# 
# To enable feature flags and analytics with PostHog:
# 
# 1. Sign up for PostHog at https://posthog.com (or use self-hosted instance)
# 2. Create a new project or use existing one
# 3. Get your Project API Key from: Settings > Project > Project Variables
# 4. Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values
#
# For client-side tracking and feature flags:
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
#
# For server-side feature flag evaluation (optional but recommended):
# Get from: Settings > User > Personal API Keys
POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=your_personal_api_key_here
#
# Note: The NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes these variables available in the browser.
# Only include the POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY on the server (do not prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_).
#
# After setting up:
# 1. Go to PostHog dashboard > Feature Flags
# 2. Create a new feature flag called "enableDebugLogs"
# 3. Set it to boolean type
# 4. Enable/disable for specific users or roll out to everyone
# 5. Changes take effect on next page load
